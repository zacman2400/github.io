<h1>My name is Zachary Miller, and I am a MD/PhD student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am broadly interested in the intersection between computer science and medicine. Currently, I spend most of my time developing and applying machine learning algorithms to address challenges in motion correction and image reconstruction in medical imaging. Outside of research, I teach students for the medical school board exams0, try to expand my mathematical knowledge base, and spend time with my fianceâ€™.
